# General responses related to the tool
  utter_what_ai_tool_is:
  - text: "The AI testing tool helps organize test cases for software utilizing artificial intelligence.
          \nMost software including AI related software contain multiple functions that need to be tested 
          \nunder a multitude of conditions.  This application helps testers organize their many test cases
          \nby providing tools to create input, context, & output trees.  The trees are saved as json files
          \nthat can be uploaded onto the site.  The AI testing tool can also create test cases from the json 
          \nfiles, which are organized into tables for testers to keep track of their test cases."

  utter_about_dashboard:
  - text: "The dashboard is the main page containing a summary on the different test cases a team/user currently has.
          \nThe dashboard displays the total number of groups, total number of test cases, the total number of 
          \ntest cases with inputs, and the total number of test cases with output are displayed."

  utter_dashboard_location:
  - text: "The dashboard is the default page of the AI testing tool. You can navigate there by clicking on 
          \nthe 'DASHBOARD' button that is part of the left vertical menu."

  utter_tool_features:
  - text: "The AI testing tool is designed to help software testers organize & form test cases.
          \nSome of the things users can do with the tool are: 
          \n- Create, save, copy, edit, & download AI testing trees.
          \n- Edit, generate & remove test cases created from context, input, & output classification trees.
          \n- Upload images & save them as part of a test case.
          \n- Group test cases based on how you want to organize testing.
          \n- Give feedback on the testing tool to help improve it."
      
  utter_reason_for_image_upload:
  - text: "The AI testing tool is designed to help with testing AI functions of a software.  Many applications
          \nnow offer image recognition that utilizes AI. Testing Those types of features requires documentation of 
          \nthe expected and actual image outputs. Each image can be uploaded onto the tool and linked to a test case 
          \nfor testers to keep track of testing results."

  utter_what_trees_are_for:
  - text: "Each AI test/classification tree represents characteristics of an AI function that is tested. Each test
          \ncase group should have a context tree to represent the different contexts being tested, an input tree
          \nfor the different inputs, and an output tree for the different outputs. When creating a test case group, 
          \nyou will need to give the 3 types of trees so that the tool can generate the different combination of 
          \ntest cases. That is why trees are crucial to using the testing tool."

  utter_why_have_test_case_groups:
  - text: "Test case groups are a set of test cases associated with a group consisting of a context, input and output 
          \nclassification tree.
          \nYou are not required to have multiple test groups, but the 'New Goup' button allows you to add more 
          \ntest case groups.  Adding new test groups helps you organize and create multiple versions of tests."

  utter_work_in_progress:
  - text: "The AI testing tool is an active graduate student project that is still a work in progress."

  utter_steps_to_give_feedback:
  - text: "To give feeback: 
                            \n1. Click on the 'CONTACT' tab on the left side of the screen.
                            \n2. Click on the phrase 'Click to view Google Feedback Form'.
                            \n3. Fill out all required parts on the Google form.
                            \n4. Click the 'Submit' button at the bottom of the form.
                            \nFeedback on the testing tool is appreciated!"

  utter_need_pwd:
  - text: "Accessing the AI testing tool requires the use of an account and password for security purposes."

  utter_dif_tree_types:
  - text: "A set of test cases will use an input, context, and output classification tree to determine the different 
          \ncombination of test cases.  
          \n- An input classification tree represents the different types of inputs that are being tested when testing
          \nfunction of an application that uses AI.
          \n- A context classification tree is like an input classification tree but represents the different contexts 
          \nbeing tested.
          \n- An output classification tree is like an input classification tree but represents the different outputs 
          \nbeing tested."
