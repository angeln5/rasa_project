# GUIDELINES:  
# Try to have between 10-15 examples per intent
#   Try to have roughly the same amount of examples for each intent (can be hard sometimes so this rule isn't stricly enforced)
#   May be better to combining intents under a more broad category instead
# Check that examples correspond to the actual intents
# Makes sure that examples are diverse
# Tokenizer does NOT read punctuation, commas, emoji, etc.
#   By default, tokenizer is case sensitive
# Synonyms are below the intents
